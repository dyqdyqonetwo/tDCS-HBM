Step1_tDCS_HBM_V.m is used to simulate brain activity in response to tDCS.
Step1_Without_stimulation.m is used to simulate brain activity without receiving tDCS stimulation.
data/FEM_E/F3a-Fp2c.mat refers to the normal electric field under the F3-Fp2 montage modelled by tDCS finite elements.
data/FEM_E/F4a-Fp1c.mat refers to the normal electric field under the F4-Fp1 montage modelled by tDCS finite elements.
data/MFM_para/FCSC_Desikan68_ave_2_para4_3.mat contains the structural connectivity matrix (SC), the functional connectivity matrix (FC_emp), and the mean-field model (para_E) trained parameters.
